# Description

Developed an AI-powered app that translates videos and audio files into sign language.\
Users can record or upload videos, which are processed by a Python-based AI model to generate sign language translations.\
The app also supports audio-to-sign language conversion, making it accessible to both speakers and non-speakers.\
Included a reference section with translations for each letter in sign language.\
Seamless integration with a custom API for data processing and result retrieval.\
